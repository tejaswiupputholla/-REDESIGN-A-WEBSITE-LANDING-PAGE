# DESCRIPTION OF TASK1:
For Task 1 of my UI/UX internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I redesigned the landing page of Swiggy using Figma, focusing on clarity, aesthetics, and usability. My goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly hero section that guides users directly to the action—entering their delivery location.I used a bold orange-yellow gradient background to reflect Swiggy’s vibrant branding and placed a strong headline, an intuitive location input bar, and a clear “FIND” button for streamlined usability.To add a personal creative touch, I hand-drew a subtle ‘S’ shape using Figma’s Pencil Tool in the background, representing Swiggy’s identity in a unique and artistic way.The design features circular food images (pizza, burger, curry) and icon-based highlights like Nearby Restaurants, Best Deals, and Fast Delivery, all framed within clean, rounded shapes for a friendly, modern look.I used tools like the Frame, Ellipse, Rectangle, Text, Gradient Fill, and Image tools to build this layout from scratch, without relying on layout grids—ensuring visual balance manually.
# Before Redesign (Original Swiggy UI)
A standard layout with a lot of information
Emphasis on offers and multiple services
No focused hero call-to-action for users to enter their location
Visual hierarchy is scattered
